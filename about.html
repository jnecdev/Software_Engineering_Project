								<h3>Vission and Mision</h3>

								<p>
The philosophy, goals and objectives of St. Benedict School are rooted on a deep

Christian faith that permeates the body of experiences that the school offers.

Since the school is truly convinced of the great need to awaken responsible

Christianity among Filipinos today, its primary concern is the total formation of

the youth through the advancement of knowledge, the promotion of culture and

the transformation of values.

									LIFE OF SAINT BENEDICT

Young Benedict was a student in Rome. The loose living and the too-natural mentality of his companions disgusted him. It was as if they had never even heard of Christ and His law of love. It was clear for him then. Rome, the great city where so many people spent their days trying to be rich and powerful, was not to his liking. He longed for the quiet of the country-side, some small cave where he could spend his days in prayer. But Cyrilla, his governess, wanted to come with him, and tried to discourage him from his "nonsense".
